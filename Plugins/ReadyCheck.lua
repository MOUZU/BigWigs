        we consider four different scenarios:
        - a raidmember does not have this addon, he will not acknowledge the request
        - a raidmember does have it, but is not responding in time (AFK), he will acknowledge but neither confirm nor deny
        - a raidmember does have it and confirms it, he will acknowledge and confirm
        - a raidmember does have it and denies it(he is not ready but not afk), he will acknowledge and deny
