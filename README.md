# BigWigs
BigWigs is a World of Warcraft AddOn to predict certain AI behaviour to improve the players performance.<br \>
This Modification is build for Patch 1.12.1 and its content for use on the <b>NostalriusBegins</b> private Server.

The adjustments were made by LYQ and for the <b>Pariah</b> Guild initially.<br \>
<b><a href="github.com/MOUZU/BigWigs">Please refer to this repository for more information.</a></b>

## Included AddOns
I've included several other BigWigs AddOns in this repository, so you only need to download and use the 'BigWigs' folder from this repository. If you happen to have any of the listed AddOns seperately I suggest removing them - in case I adjusted some of those in this repository as well.
<ul>
    <li><b>BigWigs_CommonAuras</b> <br \>  ( keeps track of certain Buffs eg. Fear Ward and Tank cooldowns )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_NefCount</b> <br \>  ( improved mechanism for Nefarian phase 1, keeps track of the Adds killed since that triggers phase 2 )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_ZombieFood</b> <br \>  ( announces if a player is getting dazed ) *modified</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_LoathebTactical</b> <br \>  ( Spore and Consumable warnings for Loatheb )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_RespawnTimers</b> <br \>  ( Trash respawn timers )</li>
</ul>

## How to install
<b>a)</b> If you choose to download the .rar file all you have to do is extract the archive in your /World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/ directory.<br />
<b>b)</b> If you download the raw code from GitHub you'll have to unzip the downloaded archive and rename the folder from 'BigWigs-master' to 'BigWigs' and place it in your /World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/ directory.
