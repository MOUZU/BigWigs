# BigWigs
BigWigs is a World of Warcraft AddOn to predict certain AI behaviour to improve the players performance.<br \>
This Modification is build for Patch 1.12.1 and its content for use on the <b>NostalriusBegins</b> private Server.

The adjustments were made by LYQ and for the <b>Pariah</b> Guild initially.<br \>

## Included AddOns
I've included several other BigWigs AddOns in this repository, so you only need to download and use the 'BigWigs' folder from this repository. If you happen to have any of the listed AddOns seperately I suggest removing them - in case I adjusted some of those in this repository as well.
<ul>
    <li><b>BigWigs_CommonAuras</b> <br \>  ( keeps track of certain Buffs eg. Fear Ward and Tank cooldowns )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_NefCount</b> <i>deactivated for now, needs rework</i> <br \>  ( improved mechanism for Nefarian phase 1, keeps track of the Adds killed since that triggers phase 2 )
* needs overhaul. Disable it for now!</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_ZombieFood</b> <i>modified</i> <br>  ( announces if a player is getting dazed )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_LoathebTactical</b> <br>  ( Spore and Consumable warnings for Loatheb )</li>
    <li><b>BigWigs_RespawnTimers</b> <br>  ( Trash respawn timers )</li>
    <li><b>WarnIcon</b>  <i>own development</i> <br> ( Displays important SpellIcons in the center of your screen. Eg. if you're standing in Rain of Fire at Gehennas or if you're a Hunter and Magmadar/Flamegor/Chromaggus is Frenzied and you need to Tranq )</li>
    <li><b>BossRecords</b>  <i>own development</i> <br> ( This Plugin will keep record of your time used in bossfights and compare it to your fastest )</li>
    <li><b>KLHThreatMeter compatibility</b>  <i>own development</i> <br> ( I enhanced the core so that bossmods are able to either reset the aggro list and/or set the mastertarget of KTM. A RaidOfficer needs to have this BigWigs so that it works properly. ) </li>
</ul>
